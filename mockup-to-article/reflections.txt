What new skills have you learned?

2. Learnt how the <sup>(Superscript) and <sub>(Subscript) elements work.
3. Learnt how to pay attention to close detail.
4. Knowing how the tree works, knowing where each element was meant to be nested.

What has been easy?

Answer:
1. Using the elements that were thought during class was pretty easy to remember.
2. The headers and paragraphs were easy.

What has been difficult?

Answer:
1. The image tag was kind of difficult, I used the "href" attribute meant for the anchor tag instead of using the "src" attribute,
but I later figured it out. Nothing I couldn't fix. :)

How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
Answer:
Yes, I did. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element was really helpful.
Also used the (Ctrl + F) key to search whenever I was stuck.
