			<p>The quokka is a small marsupial similar in appearance to a wallaby or kangaroo, 
			with distinctive short brown coarse hair and lighter underparts. 
			This speciesâ€™ body is stocky and hunched in posture and, as its other common name suggests,
			it has a noticeably short tail. It has a small head with a dark stripe on the forehead, 
			short and rounded ears, and a naked nose </p>
