Google-Udacity Scholarship Projects(Front-end)

Hi! Sheba here,
  I am a beginner web developer who is enthusiastic about tech.
I am one of the lucky scholars of the Google-Udacity(Afica) scholarship program which also has the Andela Learning Community(ALC) in support of the program.

I got in for the Front-end development track and my goal is working towards earning the main scholarship which allows me to get the Front-end Nano Degree certifcate, the purpose of this is not just about getting the certificate but earning it by being a World Class web developer.

The purpose of creating this repository is to share every project I'll be doing during my time with the scholarship, no matter how little the things I learn, I will be pushing it to this repository(code or thoughts).

So sit back and enjoy the journey with me :)
